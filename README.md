# clods-export

It is sometimes necessary to offer users of e.g. a web service the
option to export their data from your application to the outside
world.  Often, a good format would be a spreadsheet document, as it
offers a simple way of displaying and editing tabular data, and people
have over the years become quite familiar in misusing Excel for a
variety of things Excel was not designed for.

clods-export helps you by writing out OpenDocument Spreadsheet files.
